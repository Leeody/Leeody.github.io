Week 1 （30/06 - 06/07）
======

- **Monday**: We flied to JFK from PKX and arrived at Rutgers in the afternoon, June 29. Nadya and Ava showed us around here and brought us to buy some food. We also got some free pots, plaits and bowls from his office. That's really convenient! On Monday, Larry showed us our offices and told us plans in the near future. I also sent emails to some professors, asking them whether they want to be my advisors. Unluckily, mang of them were busy in summer holiday. This *searching pattern* would still continue for some days. :(  
- **Tuesday**: Today we attended a seminar about **Formalizing mathematics with Lean and Mathlib**. The professor introduced how to check a proof through these programms. Most of this seminar was understandable. To my surprise, The seminar also provided us with pizza! Delicious! :P
